#### Matlab code I wrote to segregate lung cancer stage IV drug-naive patients from healthy urinary microRNA samples (the divergence implementation is by Tsachy Weissman lab) and patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease from healthy controls based on transcriptomics data from finger-prick blood spotted on filter paper; also identified transcriptomics markers for the differences between Alzeimer's and Parkinson's disease

#### R code I wrote for clustering (the clustering is by FactoMineR, there is also a function from the Thomas Tuschl lab, the bioinformatics analyses are based on code by Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn) of urinary microRNA, transcriptomics data from finger-prick blood spotted on filter paper from patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and dose response analysis of targeted sequencing of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells
