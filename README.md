### Code I wrote in Matlab to segregate patient from healthy urinary microRNA samples (the divergence implementation is by Tsachy Weissman lab)
### Code I wrote in R for clustering (the clustering is by FactoMineR, the display is based on the representation by Thomas Tuschl lab, the bioinformatics analysis are based on code by Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn)
