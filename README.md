#### Matlab code I wrote to segregate patient from healthy urinary microRNA samples (the divergence implementation is by Tsachy Weissman lab) and patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease from healthy controls based on transcriptomics data from finger-prick blood spotted on filter paper
#### R code I wrote for clustering (the clustering is by FactoMineR, the display is based on the representation by Thomas Tuschl lab, the bioinformatics analyses are based on code by Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn) of urinary microRNA and transcriptomics data from finger-prick blood spotted on filter paper from patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease
