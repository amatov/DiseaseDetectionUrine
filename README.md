### R and Matlab code I wrote for companion diagnostics, UriWatch - LiquidThermometer, www.uriwatch.com

#### Matlab code I wrote to segregate lung cancer stage IV drug-naive patients in Rotterdam and Enschede, NL (provided by Johan de Rooij, PhD) from healthy urinary microRNA samples (the divergence implementation is by Tsachy Weissman lab) 

#### R code I wrote for disease biomarker multivariate data analysis (the principal component analysis is by FactoMineR, there is also a function for differential expression analysis and heatmaps from the Thomas Tuschl lab, an additional function for differential expression analysis, support vector machine and random forest classification is by Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn, PhD) of urinary microRNA
